</details>
<br/>

### 7.1.2. Configure Webserver

1. Go to your Spoke ressource group
2. Enable Boot diagnostics on the Webserver
   1. Create new Storage account or use an existing
3. Go to the Serial console of your Webserver
   1. Use your Credentials you setup in the previous step
4. Please run the following commands to update the Webserver and to isntall Apache 2 Webserver
   1. ```sudo apt-get update```
   2. ```sudo apt-get install apache2 -y```
5. Are the commands working?
6. Can you see the trafic is flowing through the firewall? **NO? WHY?**

### 7.1.3. Troubleshooting 1

It looks like the no traffic is working! The question is now why it isn't working and which Troubleshooting steps you do, to find the root cause.

Here some thinkgs you should have a look now.

1. Can you see the Traffic in the Firewall?
2. Can you ping the Firewall from the Webserver and reverse?
3. Are the Healthprobes are working? Load Balancer Metrics
4. Is your routing on the spoke correctly setup?
5. Is your routing on the Virtual Router on the firewalls correct?
6. Is the the NSG's blocking your traffic?
7. Did you logged into your Firewalls/Panorama to validate traffic
   1. If you want to know how to find the password go to the section [Firewall Password](#firewall-passwordusername)
8. If you fixed all the issues in the Environment go to the [Traffic Validation](#traffic-validation) section

If you have fixed the traffic issue go back to [Configure Webserver](#configure-webserver) section.
If not review again your Config or go the [Cheating Section](#cheating-section)

### 7.1.4. Traffic Validation

If you got the all traffic working you can now start with testing of the environment.

1. Test inbound HTTP to your Webserver http://<Public Load Balancer FIP>
2. Test inbound SSH to your Webserver. You can use Putty (Windows) Terminal (Mac)
   1. ssh <username>@Public Load Balancer FIP

<br/>

### 7.1.5. Autoscaling Test
In this section we will test if the Scale out/in is working and how you can test it

1. Install a second spoke application. Use [Deploy Spoke ressource](#deploy-spoke-ressource) section
2. Create on the second spoke a route table and UDR pointing to the ILB FIP
3. Establish VNet peering between spoke2 and Hub VNet [VNet Peering](#configure-vnet-peering)
4. Login in your Panorama and Create a Security Poliy for East/West traffic. Activate all Security Profiles
5. Update your Virtual routers -> static routes to enable traffic flowing
6. Install on both spoke Server Iperf3
   1. ```sudo apt-get install iperf3```
7. Run iperf3 server on both servers in the background
   1. ```sudo iperf3 -s -D -p 5000```
8. Execute the following command on server 1
   1. ```sudo iperf3 -R -c <server ip 2> -i 1 -t 3000 -T s1 -P 100 -p 5000```
9. Execute the following command on server 2
   1. ```sudo iperf3 -R -c <server ip 1> -i 1 -t 3000 -T s1 -P 100 -p 5000```
10. Check on the Azure Portal your Application Insights
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Azure_Training/main/Azure_Autoscaling_Lab/Images/appinsights.png)
11. In Application Insights select **Metrics** on the left side. Keep **Scope** and **Metric Namespace** as it is and change the Metric field to **panSessionThroughputKbps**
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Azure_Training/main/Azure_Autoscaling_Lab/Images/appinsights2.png)
12. Your output should similiar like this. **If NOT WHY? Troubleshooting**
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Azure_Training/main/Azure_Autoscaling_Lab/Images/appinsights3.png)
13. After 2-3 minutes you can check VMSS your ressource if it scales out.
    1.  Scale Out
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Azure_Training/main/Azure_Autoscaling_Lab/Images/scaleout.png)
    1. Scale Out Complete
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Azure_Training/main/Azure_Autoscaling_Lab/Images/scaleout1.png)
14. When the Scale out completed you can go to your Panorama and check if a new Firewalls is added to your Device Group
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Azure_Training/main/Azure_Autoscaling_Lab/Images/panscale.png)

In case you don't find the reason why you didn't see any metrics or logs check the [Cheating Section](#cheating-section)
<br/>

# 8. Congratulations!!!

Congratulations,Â  you have successfully completed the following steps:
- Configure Panorama
- configure Azure Environment to allow traffic flow
- Troubleshooting
- Traffic Flow Validation
- Autoscaling Validation/Test

   1. ```terraform output password ```
   2. ```terraform output username ```
   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Azure_Training/main/Azure_Autoscaling_Lab/Images/username_password.png)
4. After that you can login into your Firewalls over the Public IP attached to the instances (NOT over the Frontend IP of Public Load Balancer) If you don't know how to find the PIP of your firewall go please to the [Firewall IP Information](#firewall-ip-information) section

## 9.2. Firewall IP Information
In this section will show you how to find your IP Information in a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)
1. Go to your ressource group where your VMSS is deployed
2. In the ressource group select your VMSS object (example: inbound-VMSS)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Azure_Training/main/Azure_Autoscaling_Lab/Images/vmss.png)
3. inside the VMSS click on Instances
